## Best Practices

* Written from the USER'S perspective
* Focus on the user experience
  - Leave out technical details & jargon
* Template:
  - As a (type of) user, I want (goal or objective/feature), so that (benefit or value).
* Be specific (not vague)
  - Be targeted & measurable
  - Acceptance criteria
* Be mindful of 'Epic' stories
  - Often an opportunity to split into smaller stories
* Story can never be too small
  - Easier to target/distribute work
  - Sense of accomplishment

## Samples

* "GitLit toggle":
  - As a user, I want to be able to toggle on/off if I'm ready to git lit, so that other users can connect with me.

* "As a user, upon landing, I want to see a login and sign up page, so that I know what my options are for creating an account.":
  - As a user, I want to be able to create an account/sign up.
  - As a user, I want to be able to log in to the app if I already have an account.

* "As a user, I want a way to accept/reject/postpone a date experience, so that everyone is comfortable & 'on board'."
