# Warmup: Many-to-Many Relationships

The goal of this warmup is to continue to familiarize yourself with many-to-many relationships in relational databases and how to model them. Your task:

1. Come up with three conceptual examples of a many-to-many relationship
2. Draw an ERD for both of your examples
  * You can use an online tool or whiteboard

3. STRETCH: Write out SQL (DDL) schema for your ERDs
4. EXTRA STRETCH: Write out SQL (DML) seed data for your ERDs
